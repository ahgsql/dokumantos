1. Navigate to the `front` folder:

   ```bash
   cd front
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Additionally, for Tailwind CSS during development, run:
   ```bash
   npm run tailwind
   ```

The frontend server will start on port 4000 by default.

## Backend (server)

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose

### Getting Started

To run the backend server:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   - For normal start:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   - For development with watch mode:
   ```bash
   node --watch server.js
   ```

The backend server will start accordingly.

## Planned Enhancements
